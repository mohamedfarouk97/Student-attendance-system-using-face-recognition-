# Student-attendance-system-using-face-recognition-
This project aims to develop a student attendance system that utilizes face detection, recognition, and machine learning models. The literature review explores different face detection and recognition techniques, including Viola-Jones, HOG, PCA, LBP, and deep learning-based approaches like DeepFace and FaceNet. Additionally, the review discusses machine learning models, specifically SVM and KNN, for classification and pattern recognition. The conceptual framework incorporates theories and practices from computer vision, pattern recognition, and biometrics. The literature review provides insights into the strengths and limitations of different techniques and guides the selection of the most suitable technique for the student attendance system.

Microsoft SQL Server 2019: This is a relational database management system that is used to store and manage student profiles and attendance records securely.

ASP.NET: This is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that is used to develop the student attendance system.

Visual Studio Code: This is a code editor developed by Microsoft that is used for writing and debugging the code for the student attendance system.
