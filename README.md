# Student-attendance-system-using-face-recognition-
This project aims to develop a student attendance system that utilizes face detection, recognition, and machine learning models. The literature review explores different face detection and recognition techniques, including Viola-Jones, HOG, PCA, LBP, and deep learning-based approaches like DeepFace and FaceNet. Additionally, the review discusses machine learning models, specifically SVM and KNN, for classification and pattern recognition. The conceptual framework incorporates theories and practices from computer vision, pattern recognition, and biometrics. The literature review provides insights into the strengths and limitations of different techniques and guides the selection of the most suitable technique for the student attendanceÂ system.
